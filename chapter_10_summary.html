            <ul>  <li>Table below details these specifics for each plant-to-DC carrier. Your firm may establish and maintain IT synchronization with one or more plant-to-DC carriers with these costs and benefits.</li>
  <li>Decision options associated with each plant-to-DC carrier are as follows:</li>
  <li>Decision Option "0": Do not have IT synchronization.</li>
  <li>Decision Option "1": Establish and maintain IT synchronization with costs and other ramifications as described above.</li>
  <li>Note that these options are carrier-specific. A separate IT-synchronization decision is required for each of the six available plant-to-DC carriers, carriers I to N.</li>
  <li>Exhibit 12: IT Synchronization with Carriers, Costs and Benefits</li>
  <li>IT Synchronization with Sub-Assembly Component Suppliers</li>
  <li>The specifics of supplier IT synchronization within FLEXEE are as follows:</li>
  <li>Delivery Performance Improvement: IT-synchronization linkages improve surface transportation delivery performance for sub-assembly component suppliers. With greater delivery reliability, the relative attractiveness of surface transport compared to air transport obviously improves.</li>
  <li>Quality Improvement: An IT-synchronization linkage improves the failure rate of a supplier's sub- assembly components. Failure rates decrease based on closer synchronization between buyer (your firm) and the sub-assembly component supplier.</li>
</ul>
