<h2>Chapter 12: Performance Evaluation</h2>

<p>
  Since there are many facets of evaluation to consider in a business, a multi-dimensional quantitative performance evaluation scorecard is used in FLEX. Current performance and change in performance are considered in this multi-dimensional quantitative performance evaluation scorecard.
</p>

<p>
  The FLEX scorecard is perhaps described more aptly as a boardroom-level scorecard. It focuses on top-line boardroom kinds of financial, operational, customer, and external performance measures and sub-measures.
</p>

<p>
  The FLEX scorecard is based on a ranking of performance on each sub-measure. These rank-order comparisons across all competing firms within your industry avoid the undue influence of particularly extreme values of individual sub-measures. This FLEX scorecard is a within-industry performance evaluation system. Comparisons across industries are problematic due to variations in environmental and competitive milieu.
</p>

<p>The FLEX scorecard includes the following financial, operational, customer, and external measures:</p>

<h4>Financial Measures:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Net Profit Margin</li>
  <li>Operating Margin</li>
  <li>Inventory Turns</li>
  <li>Sales Growth</li>
</ul>

<h4>Operational Measures:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Inventory Turnover</li>
  <li>Fill Rate</li>
  <li>Production Deviation</li>
  <li>Defect Rate</li>
  <li>Controllable Procurement and Manufacturing Costs to Revenue</li>
  <li>Transportation Expenses per Unit Sold</li>
  <li>Forecast Accuracy</li>
</ul>

<h4>Customer Measures:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Market Penetration Rate</li>
  <li>Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI)</li>
  <li>External Measures:</li>
  <li>Revenue Growth</li>
  <li>Earnings Growth</li>
  <li>Consistency Score (0,1)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This chapter describes the recommended FLEX quantitative performance evaluation mechanism. Since there are many facets of evaluation to consider in a business, a multi-dimensional scorecard is used. As youâ€™ll note, current performance and change in performance are considered in this multi-dimensional quantitative performance evaluation scorecard.
</p>


<p>
  Many things matter in evaluating the performance of a business. It's hard to argue with profitability-like measures as the correct things to examine to assess the long-run performance of a business. However, in a shorter-run perspective, other things matter too. These "other things" are leading indicators of future profitability and root causes of profitability.
</p>

<p>
  Multiple measures of performance evaluation obviously lead to conflicts. Short-run and long-run trade-offs are obvious. For example, by reducing inventories and product support spending (marketing and service spending), current costs will decrease, and profits will tend to increase. However, in the long run, these might be exactly the wrong things to do to maximize long-run profitability. Subtler trade-offs arise in potentially conflicting performance measures that move in opposite directions. For example, inventory reductions save costs on the inventory and manufacturing fronts but may lead to shortages to meet the levels of customer demand in the distribution centers. Balancing all of these conflicting trade-offs is the challenge for management.
</p>

<p>
  The various performance measures within FLEX are designed to monitor all key elements of performance assessment: efficiency (input usage); effectiveness (output quality); productivity (conversion of inputs into output); firm-wide profitability; and external performance (e.g., change in market share and customer satisfaction perceptions).
</p>

<h3>The FLEX Scorecard</h3>

<p>
  The FLEX scorecard is perhaps described more aptly as a boardroom-level scorecard. It focuses on top-line boardroom kinds of financial, operational, customer, and external performance measures and sub-measures. The FLEX scorecard includes the measures and weights described in Exhibits 19-22. Each firm in your products industry submits their raw data to the Products Trade Association, which provides your firm's personal scorecard every quarter.
</p>

<p>
  The FLEX scorecard is based on a ranking of performance on each sub-measure. These rank-order comparisons across all competing firms within your industry avoid the undue influence of particularly extreme values of individual sub-measures. This FLEX scorecard is a within-industry performance evaluation system. Comparisons across industries are problematic due to variations in environmental and competitive milieu.
</p>

<p>
  Your firm receives weighted points for each competitor for whom your performance on a sub-measure is better. For some of the sub-measures, "better" means a lower sub-measure value (e.g., the "Controllable Procurement and Manufacturing Costs to Revenue" is a lower-is-better sub-measure). For example, if your firm's ratio of "Net Profits" to "Revenues" is better than three other firms' ratios, your firm receives 9 points. (Of course, the top-performing firm on "Net Income" to "Revenues" ratio in a 6-firm industry would receive 15 points.) In general, the maximum available points on any sub-measure are W(N-1) where "W" is the sub-measure's weight and "N" is the number of firms in the industry. Points accumulate each quarter throughout the FLEX exercise.
</p>

<p>
  To avoid an overemphasis on minor quarter-to-quarter variations in the calculation of the ranking of firms on the performance sub-measures in the FLEX scorecard, minor differences in the sub-measures are
treated as ties in the calculation of ranking points. The thresholds for differences to be treated as meaningful are listed in Exhibits 19-22 for each sub-measure. For example, differences of 0.2% or less for "Net Profit Margin" are considered to be statistically insignificant, and firms within 0.2% of each other would be treated as being tied. Thus, two firms with ratios of Net Income to Revenues of 4.5% and 4.6% would be treated as being tied in the calculation of ranking position and associated points received in any quarter.</p>
<p>A sample FLEX scorecard is shown in Exhibit 22. You receive this scorecard automatically each quarter as the first page of your financial and operating reports. This scorecard provides comparatives to assess how your firm's data compares to the industry averages and industry bests on every KPI. You can assess where your firm stands compared to competitors with this scorecard.</p>

<h3>External Measures: Financial Investors' Perspective</h3>

<p>
  The external measure in the FLEX scorecard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of the firm's attractiveness to potential financial investors. 
  This measure is constructed as an index based on three critical metrics: <strong>Revenue Growth</strong>, <strong>Earnings Growth</strong>, and 
  <strong>Consistency of Growth</strong> over recent quarters. The FI Index helps investors assess the stability and growth potential of the firm, 
  guiding investment decisions.
</p>

<h4>Metrics Used in the FI Index:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Revenue Growth:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This metric reflects the percentage increase in the firm's revenue over a specified period.</li>
      <li>The index assigns scores as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>1â€“10% growth: Score = 1</li>
          <li>10â€“20% growth: Score = 2</li>
          <li>20â€“30% growth: Score = 3</li>
          <li>Above 30% growth: Score = 4</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Earnings Growth:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This metric captures the percentage increase in the firm's earnings over a specified period.</li>
      <li>The index assigns scores as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>1â€“20% growth: Score = 1</li>
          <li>20â€“30% growth: Score = 2</li>
          <li>Above 30% growth: Score = 3</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Consistency of Growth:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This binary metric evaluates whether the firm's earnings have consistently increased over the last five quarters.</li>
      <li>The index assigns scores as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Consistent earnings growth over the last 5 quarters: Score = 1</li>
          <li>Inconsistent earnings growth over the last 5 quarters: Score = 0</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Calculating the FI Index:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The FI Index is calculated by summing the scores from the three metrics.</li>
  <li>The possible range of the FI Index is 2 to 8.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Interpretation:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A higher FI Index indicates a firm with strong and consistent growth, making it more attractive to investors.</li>
  <li>The FI Index allows for easy comparison of firms within the same industry, facilitating informed investment decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Firm A:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Revenue Growth: 25% (Score = 3)</li>
      <li>Earnings Growth: 15% (Score = 1)</li>
      <li>Consistency of Growth: Yes (Score = 1)</li>
      <li><strong>FI Index = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Firm B:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Revenue Growth: 35% (Score = 4)</li>
      <li>Earnings Growth: 25% (Score = 2)</li>
      <li>Consistency of Growth: No (Score = 0)</li>
      <li><strong>FI Index = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the FLEX scorecard, the FI Index is visualized in a comparative graph, displaying the index scores of all firms in the industry. 
  This graphical representation aids in quickly identifying firms with superior growth characteristics, providing a clear overview of their relative investment attractiveness.
