            <h2>Chapter 6: Transportation Decisions</h2>
            <ul>  <li>The FLEXEE transportation decisions include choosing transportation modes (surface and air) for inbound sub-assembly components and selecting transportation modes and carriers for finished goods shipments from your plant to your distribution centers (DCs).</li>
  <li>Different kinds of transportation decisions are required in different parts of your supply chain:</li>
  <li>Inbound Raw Materials: Vendors provide inbound transportation as part of their bundled prices. No decisions required.</li>
  <li>Inbound Sub-Assembly Components: Joint responsibility between suppliers and manufacturers. Suppliers quote unbundled component and transportation mode costs. Manufacturers choose modes; suppliers arrange carriers.</li>
  <li>Plant-to-DC Shipments: Manufacturers are responsible for transportation decisions related to within- firm shipments of postponed production and finished goods from plants to DCs.</li>
  <li>DC Shipments to Customers: Ship by surface from within-region DCs or by air from DC1 if no local DC exists. No active decisions required.</li>
  <li>Based on past experience, air transportation ensures 100% delivery reliability within the current quarter, while surface transportation averages about 70% delivery reliability. Current transportation costs per unit between your plant and regional DCs for all carriers are shown in Exhibit 9.</li>
  <li>Customer Shipment Transportation Costs (Per Unit)</li>
  <li>Outbound Shipments combine the data from Exhibits 9 and 10 to determine total transportation costs for any choice of plant-to-DC carrier.</li>
