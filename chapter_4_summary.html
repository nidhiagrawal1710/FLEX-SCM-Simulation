            <h2>Chapter 4: Manufacturing Decisions</h2>
            <ul>  <li>Your FLEXEE firm makes production decisions for each of your products each quarter. The FLEXEE production sub-process is build-to-plan (build-to-stock).</li>
  <li>In addition to production decisions, you also control product-specific emergency production limits. If finished goods inventory is insufficient to meet end-user demand, an emergency production order is executed automatically up to the product's specified emergency production limit.</li>
  <li>Production Volume Flexeeibility</li>
  <li>Production volume flexeeibility decisions permit you to exceed quarter-over-quarter production order change limits (maximum change of 10,000 units from the previous quarterâ€™s production level).</li>
  <li>Manufacturing Process & Decisions</li>
  <li>Your FLEXEE firm makes production decisions for each of your products each quarter. These production volume decisions include both completed products and postponed production. In addition, you must decide on emergency production limits for each completed product each quarter.</li>
  <li>Manufacturing and Postponed Production Costs</li>
  <li>Note: DC-specific "Postponed Production" costs are incremental, above and beyond "Postponed Production" costs recorded in the "Manufacturing Plant" column. For example, the total fixed costs (per order) associated with postponed production for SHA completed at DC1 are $20,000 + $5,000 = $25,000.</li>
  <li>If finished goods inventory is insufficient to meet end-user demand, an emergency production order is executed automatically up to the product's specified emergency production limit:</li>
