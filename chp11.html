<h2>Chapter 11: Financial Reports</h2>

<p>
  Understanding and tracking your firm's financial and operational metrics is crucial for effective management 
  and decision-making in the FLEX simulation.
</p>

<h3>Key Financial Reports</h3>

<h4>Corporate P&amp;L Statement</h4>
<p>
  The Corporate P&amp;L Statement aggregates all product-specific profit-and-loss statements into an overall corporate 
  profit-and-loss statement. A variety of line items appear on the Corporate P&amp;L Statement only, because it is not 
  possible to unambiguously allocate those costs to specific products in specific regions for specific channels.
</p>

<p><strong>Definitions of non-obvious line items on the Corporate P&amp;L Statement follow:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Administrative Overhead ("Administrative O/H"):</strong> $80,000/quarter and $120,000/quarter per product in channels 1 and 2, respectively, in all market regions.</li>
