<h2>Chapter 8: Demand Management Decisions</h2>

<p>Your FLEX firm is responsible for channel selection, pricing, and marketing spending decisions.</p>

<h3>Introduction/Drop Decisions</h3>

<p>
  You may introduce products into regions or channels not currently active or drop products from regions or channels.
  Introduction incurs a one-time cost of $300,000 in Channel #1 in any region and $100,000 in Channel #2 in any region.
  Dropping a product from active distribution in a region or channel incurs no special costs. Introduction costs are
  recorded under "Introductions" on your financial statements.
</p>

<p>
  To "activate" a product in a channel/region, change the "Active Product?" status to "Yes." To drop a product from
  active status in a channel or region, change its "Active Product?" status to "No." Once a product is active in a
  channel/region, it remains active until you make an explicit drop ("No") decision.
</p>

<p>
  You must explicitly introduce or drop a product from a channel and/or region, regardless of your marketing spending and
  sales volume forecasts. Setting marketing spending to zero does not result in the associated product being dropped from
  that market region and channel.
</p>

<p>
  If you drop a product from active distribution in a region or channel, you must also reduce the marketing spending to $0.
  Otherwise, marketing spending will continue to occur, perhaps in anticipation of a future relaunch.
</p>

<p>
  Given the capacity constraints associated with your manufacturing plant, your firm has a policy of limiting simultaneous
  new product-region-channel launches to a maximum of three in any quarter. For example, if you choose to launch a product
  in two channels of a region in the same quarter, that action represents a total of two new launches, and only one other
  launch would be possible in that quarter in any other combinations of channels and regions.
</p>

<h3>Channel Decisions</h3>

<p>
  There are two sales channels within FLEX market regions: retail and direct. You may choose to distribute your products
  in either, both, or neither channel in each market region. ("Neither" is the same as dropping a product from active
  distribution in a channel and region.)
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Channel 1: Retail Channel</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Serves individual consumers who purchase products for home use and businesses.</li>
      <li>Retailers stock products along with other similar and complementary electronic products.</li>
      <li>Provides point-of-purchase support for in-person shoppers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Channel 2: Direct Channel</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Firms sell products directly to final customers via an e-commerce channel.</li>
      <li>The price in the direct channel is the final price paid by customers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Alternative distribution channels tap into common and distinct customers, partially competing with each other.
  Some customers only purchase a product if it's available in their preferred distribution channel, while others shift
  some of their purchases towards new channels as they become available. Introducing new channels can grow the market
  by attracting channel-captive customers who did not purchase previously due to the absence of products in their
  preferred channel.
</p>

<p>
  Differential order processing costs accrue for sales in these two channels in all regions: $4/unit for Channel 1
  (Retail) and $24/unit for Channel 2 (Direct).
</p>




<h3>Price Decisions</h3>

<p>
  You set prices for each product in each region and channel every quarter. The retail channel price is the bulk-rate price 
  for units purchased for resale by retailers. In the direct channel, you set the final price paid by end-users.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Retail Channel Pricing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You set the manufacturer price, which is marked up by retailers.</li>
      <li>Consult current research studies to determine average retailer prices in various regions.</li>
      <li>You do not control final selling prices in the retail channel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Direct Channel Pricing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You control the final selling prices as you sell directly to end-users.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Potential cross-channel competition should be considered when setting prices. Higher prices are usually associated with 
  lower demand levels in all markets and channels. Price sensitivities in the markets are unknown, and you will need to learn 
  about price responsiveness through experience and research studies.
</p>

<p>
  Price adjustments incur costs due to managerial efforts, customer-facing communications, and physical costs (menu costs). 
  Each price change for a product in a channel and region costs $10,000 plus $200 per dollar change in price (increase or 
  decrease) and 0.25% of current-quarter revenues. These costs are recorded as "Price Changes" in your firm's profit-and-loss 
  statements in the quarter the price change occurs.
</p>

<h3>Marketing Spending Decisions</h3>

<p>
  A marketing spending budget is required for each product in each region and channel. Managed by your firmâ€™s region and 
  channel managers, this budget covers advertising, promotion, and sales force efforts. Allocate funds as you see fit; 
  spending does not have to be equal in all regions and channels.
</p>

<p>
  Corporate policy limits marketing spending variations to $100,000 from their initial values for any product in any 
  channel and region. Marketing spending is believed to increase demand for products, though the relationship between 
  spending and sales is unknown. You'll need to learn about marketing's influence on sales through your experience.
</p>

<p>
  Since channels overlap, marketing spending in one channel of a region will have some spillover influence on customers 
  in the other channel. Marketing efforts typically target a broad audience, not specific channels. If you drop a product 
  from active distribution in a region or channel, reduce the marketing spending to $0. Otherwise, marketing spending will 
  continue, potentially in anticipation of a future relaunch.
