<h2>Chapter 10: Enterprise Integration</h2>

<p>
  Effective enterprise integration is essential for optimizing supply chain operations and ensuring seamless collaboration 
  with partners. In the FLEX Supply Chain Management Simulation, you are responsible for making strategic decisions that 
  enhance Enterprise IT integration across your firm's supply chain and with external partners.
</p>

<h3>IT Synchronization with Plant-To-DC Carriers</h3>

<p>
  You coordinate your transportation needs with specific plant-to-DC carriers via IT synchronization efforts. 
  By linking your IT system with those of partners, an enhanced degree of supply chain synchronization is achieved 
  in transportation with corresponding improvements in surface transportation delivery performance.
</p>

<p><strong>The specifics of plant-to-DC carrier IT synchronization within FLEX are as follows:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Setup and Maintenance Costs:</strong> IT synchronization involves a one-time cost per carrier to implement initially 
    and a carrier-specific ongoing per-quarter IT-synchronization maintenance cost. You may terminate IT synchronization 
    with a plant-to-DC carrier at any time at no cost. If you subsequently decide to reestablish IT synchronization, the 
    one-time setup cost would again accrue in the initial quarter of IT synchronization with any plant-to-DC carrier.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Delivery Performance Improvement:</strong> IT-synchronization linkages improve surface transportation delivery 
    performance for plant-to-DC carriers. With greater delivery reliability, the relative attractiveness of surface transport 
    compared to air transport obviously improves.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The table below details these specifics for each plant-to-DC carrier. Your firm may establish and maintain IT synchronization 
  with one or more plant-to-DC carriers with these costs and benefits.
</p>

<p><strong>Decision options associated with each plant-to-DC carrier are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Decision Option "0":</strong> Do not have IT synchronization.</li>
  <li><strong>Decision Option "1":</strong> Establish and maintain IT synchronization with costs and other ramifications as described above.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Note that these options are carrier-specific. A separate IT-synchronization decision is required for each of the six 
  available plant-to-DC carriers, carriers I to N.

<h3>IT Synchronization with Sub-Assembly Component Suppliers</h3>

<p>
  You may establish vendor-managed inventory systems with your sub-assembly component suppliers. 
  By linking your IT system with the IT systems of one or more of your suppliers, an enhanced degree of 
  supply chain synchronization is achieved in procurement, with corresponding improvements in surface 
  transportation delivery performance and component quality (i.e., a reduction in sub-assembly component failure rates).
</p>

<p><strong>The specifics of supplier IT synchronization within FLEX are as follows:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Setup and Maintenance Costs:</strong> IT synchronization involves a one-time cost per supplier to implement initially 
    and a supplier-specific ongoing per-quarter maintenance cost. You may terminate IT synchronization with a sub-assembly 
    component supplier at any time at no cost. If you subsequently decide to reestablish IT synchronization, the one-time setup 
    cost would again accrue in the initial quarter of IT synchronization with any sub-assembly component supplier.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Delivery Performance Improvement:</strong> IT-synchronization linkages improve surface transportation delivery performance 
    for sub-assembly component suppliers. With greater delivery reliability, the relative attractiveness of surface transport 
    compared to air transport obviously improves.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Quality Improvement:</strong> An IT-synchronization linkage improves the failure rate of a supplier's sub-assembly components. 
    Failure rates decrease based on closer synchronization between buyer (your firm) and the sub-assembly component supplier.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The table below details these specifics for each sub-assembly component supplier. Your firm may establish and maintain 
  IT synchronization with one or more sub-assembly component suppliers with these costs and benefits.
</p>

<p><strong>Decision options associated with each sub-assembly component supplier are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Decision Option "0":</strong> Do not have IT synchronization.</li>
  <li><strong>Decision Option "1":</strong> Establish and maintain IT synchronization with costs and other ramifications as described above.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Note that these options are supplier specific. A separate IT-synchronization decision is required for each of the 
  seven available sub-assembly component suppliers, suppliers A to G.
