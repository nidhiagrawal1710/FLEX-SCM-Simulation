            <h2>Chapter 5: Distribution Decisions</h2>
            <ul>  <li>Even if you choose not to have a distribution center in a market region other than Region 1, you can still have sales in that market region if you choose to have products in active distribution in any channel in that market region. Such sales would be serviced directly from your Region 1 DC.</li>
  <li>While you must always have an owned DC in Region 1, you may or may not wish to have DCs in other regions. If you choose not to have a distribution center in a market region other than Region 1, sales in that market region would be serviced directly from your Region 1 DC.</li>
  <li>If you have a distribution center in a market region:</li>
  <li>Replacement parts demand is fulfilled from that regional DC, requiring inventories of sub-assembly components to be maintained at those regional DCs.</li>
  <li>Postponed production is possible with owned "local" region distribution centers, requiring inventorying of sub-assembly components at that regional DC.</li>
  <li>When a regional distribution center opens, there will be no inventory of the Motherboard sub-assembly component available at that DC for the first quarter. All first-quarter usage of the Motherboard will be on an emergency basis, with consequent first-quarter emergency ordering costs.</li>
  <li>Transportation of finished goods to customers from a regional DC is via surface transportation. Otherwise, air transportation is required to ship finished goods from the distribution center in Region 1 to customers in other regions without a local distribution center.</li>
  <li>Three distribution center decision options exist in regions other than Region 1:</li>
  <li>Decision Option "0" (no distribution center): No distribution center costs exist.</li>
  <li>Decision Option "1" (outsourced third-party distribution center): Involves outsourcing your regional distribution center to a reputable partner in a region.</li>
</ul>
