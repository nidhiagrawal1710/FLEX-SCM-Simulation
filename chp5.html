<h2>Chapter 5: Distribution Decisions</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Distribution decisions in FLEX include determining whether to have distribution centers (DCs) in regions other than your home-base (Region 1) and, if so, deciding the form of those DCs (outsourced vs. owned).
 For each region-specific DC, you also face decisions related to RFID application for products distributed through the retail channel (Channel #1), whether to enable cross-docking with one or more carriers, and surface shipping methods for
  finished goods inventory shipped from DC1 to other DCs and for inbound surface shipments of sub-assembly components to each DC.</p>


<p>Even if you choose not to have a distribution center in a market region other than Region 1, 
you can still have sales in that market region if you choose to have products in active distribution in any channel in that market region. 
Such sales would be serviced directly from your Region 1 DC.</p>

<p>Retailers require your products to be equipped with RFID (radio-frequency identification). RFID is applied to your outbound products at your distribution centers. Only products distributed to the retail channel (Channel #1) require RFID application. At each distribution center, you may use outsourced or insourced RFID application.</p>
<p>With cross-docking enabled at a DC, inventory holding costs and DC operating costs are reduced because inbound shipments are directly transferred to outbound carriers with reduced regional-DC handling, warehousing, and administration. Cross-docking is possible at all regional DCs (i.e., at third-party and owned regional DCs) other than DC1.</p>
<p>Surface shipping methods provide three levels of surface shipping for finished goods shipments from DC1 to other DCs and for inbound surface shipments of sub-assembly components to each DC. Surface shipping methods include expedited, standard, and economy surface shipping with associated consequences for surface shipping delivery reliability and cost.</p>


<h3>Distribution Center Decisions</h3>

<p>
  While you must always have an owned DC in Region 1, you may or may not wish to have DCs in other regions. 
  If you choose not to have a distribution center in a market region other than Region 1, sales in that market region 
  would be serviced directly from your Region 1 DC.
</p>

<p>If you have a distribution center in a market region:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Replacement parts demand is fulfilled from that regional DC, requiring inventories of sub-assembly components 
    to be maintained at those regional DCs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Postponed production is possible with owned "local" region distribution centers, requiring inventorying of 
    sub-assembly components at that regional DC.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a regional distribution center opens, there will be no inventory of the Motherboard sub-assembly component 
    available at that DC for the first quarter. All first-quarter usage of the Motherboard will be on an emergency 
    basis, with consequent first-quarter emergency ordering costs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transportation of finished goods to customers from a regional DC is via surface transportation. Otherwise, air 
    transportation is required to ship finished goods from the distribution center in Region 1 to customers in other 
    regions without a local distribution center.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Three distribution center decision options exist in regions other than Region 1:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Decision Option "0" (no distribution center):</strong> No distribution center costs exist.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Decision Option "1" (outsourced third-party distribution center):</strong> Involves outsourcing your regional 
    distribution center to a reputable partner in a region. This option includes one-time costs of $100,000 to open, 
    $50,000 in one-time costs to close, $50,000 in quarterly costs, and inventory charges of 5% based on the inventory value.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Decision Option "2" (operate owned distribution center):</strong> Involves one-time costs of $250,000 to open, 
    $150,000 in one-time costs to close, $25,000 in quarterly costs, and inventory charges of 3% based on the inventory value.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Your firm can only have one DC in a region. The DC status code “2” denotes an owned DC in a region, not two DCs in that region. 
  DC openings and conversions (from outsourced to owned or vice versa) occur at the start of the next quarter. 
  Existing inventory is automatically transferred to the new DC form. The FLEX software automatically disposes of residual 
  inventory of sub-assembly components and finished goods when a DC is closed. The inventory is converted to cash at the 
  current balance-sheet values and a corresponding disposal cost of 20% of the inventory's value accrues.
</p>




<h3>RFID Application for Retail-Channel Sales</h3>

<p>
  Retailers now require that your products be equipped with RFID. RFID is applied to your outbound products at your distribution centers. 
  Only products distributed to the retail channel (Channel #1) require RFID application.
</p>

<p>At each distribution center, you have two choices for RFID application:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Decision Option 0 (outsourced RFID application):</strong> Adds $11 in variable costs to all products sold through the retail channel.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Decision Option 1 (insourced RFID application):</strong> Requires a one-time investment of $350,000, reducing variable costs to $1 per product 
    sold through the retail channel. This investment is recorded under "Consulting Fees" on your corporate profit-and-loss statement. 
    RFID insourcing is only possible if you already have or simultaneously open a DC in a region.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Your RFID decision is specific to each distribution center. Thus, you may choose to insource at some DCs and outsource at others.
</p>

<h3>Emergency Carriers for Plant-to-DC Shipments</h3>

<p>
  You must choose an emergency carrier for each of your DCs (other than DC1). This emergency carrier is used for plant-to-DC transportation 
  shipments required on an emergency basis.
</p>

<h3>Cross-Docking</h3>

<p>
  Cross-docking reduces inventory holding costs and DC operating costs by directly transferring inbound shipments to outbound carriers 
  with reduced handling, warehousing, and administration. Cross-docking is possible at all regional DCs (other than DC1) with carriers K, L, M, and N.
</p>

<h3>Costs and Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>One-time fixed costs:</strong> $7,500 per carrier.</li>
  <li><strong>Ongoing (quarterly) maintenance costs:</strong> $2,500 per carrier.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced inventory charges:</strong> 0.5% reduction, with a maximum inventory valuation of $5,000,000.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced quarterly DC operating costs:</strong> $1,000 per carrier enabled at a regional DC other than DC1.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Cross-docking costs on the “Corporate P&amp;L Statement” reflect the net costs (positive or negative) associated with cross-docking, 
  including the reduction in finished goods inventory charges associated with cross-docked shipments.
</p>

<p>
  At each distribution center (other than DC1), you have two choices for cross-docking with carriers K, L, M, and N:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Decision Option 0:</strong> No cross-docking exists.</li>
  <li><strong>Decision Option 1:</strong> Cross-docking is enabled with a specific carrier.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Cross-docking involves inbound shipments from DC1 to another DC. If there are no inbound shipments to a DC via a carrier with 
  cross-docking enabled in a particular quarter, there are no cross-docking cost savings for that carrier in that quarter.
</p>

<h3>Surface shipping methods</h3>
<p>Surface shipping methods provide three levels of surface shipping for finished goods shipments from DC1 to other DCs and for inbound surface shipments of sub-assembly components to each DC. These methods include expedited, standard, and economy surface shipping with associated consequences for delivery reliability and cost.</p>




<h3>Finished Goods Inventory (FGI)</h3>
<p>Specific to each DC (other than DC1) and applies to all carriers' surface shipments of finished goods from DC1 to that DC. Details are provided in Chapter 7 (Transportation Decisions).</p>

<h3>Sub-Assembly Components (SAC)</h3>
<p>Provides three levels of surface shipping for inbound sub-assembly components to each DC. Details are provided in Chapter 4 (Procurement Decisions).</p>
