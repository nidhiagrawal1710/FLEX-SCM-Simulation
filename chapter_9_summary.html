            <ul>  <li>Quarterly sales forecasts are required for each product, region, and channel.</li>
  <li>Forecasting accuracy directly affects administrative overhead: 1% inaccuracy = 1% cost increase.</li>
  <li>Maximum penalty: overhead can double with poor forecasting.</li>
  <li>Forecast error costs are recorded in the P&L as 'Forecast Inaccuracy'.</li>
  <li>Accurate forecasting improves operational efficiency and lowers inventory imbalance risk.</li>
  <li>Forecasting formula: Accuracy = 100 Ã— (1 - |Forecast - Actual| / Actual)</li>
  <li>Forecasting affects both direct cost penalties and long-term performance evaluation scores</li>
</ul>
