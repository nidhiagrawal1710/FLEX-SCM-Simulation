            <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>The simulation is set in the consumer electronics industry, featuring a company that produces two generic products: a Smart Home Assistant and a Smart Thermostat. These products share common subassemblies and raw materials, allowing for streamlined procurement and production processes.</li>
  <li>Understand the individual components of the supply chain, including procurement, production, inventory management, and distribution, and how they interact to form an integrated system.</li>
  <li>Learn to balance various aspects of the supply chain, such as cost, quality, speed, and flexeeibility, and understand the trade-offs involved in optimizing overall performance.</li>
  <li>Simulate the competitive pressures and market dynamics that influence supply chain decisions, allowing participants to develop strategies for maintaining a competitive edge.</li>
  <li>Appreciating Information Flows and Integration with Decision Making:</li>
  <li>Gain insights into the critical role of information flows within the supply chain and learn how to integrate this information into effective decision-making processes.</li>
  <li>Enhancing and Encouraging Fact-Based Analysis and Decision Making:</li>
  <li>Foster the ability to conduct fact-based analysis using data from the simulation, encouraging informed and evidence-based decision making in supply chain management.</li>
  <li>The goal of these learning objectives in the FLEXEE simulation is to equip participants with the knowledge, skills, and practical experience necessary to excel in supply chain management and production planning. Specifically, the objectives aim to:</li>
  <li>Enhance Strategic Decision-Making:</li>
