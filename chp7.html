<h2>Chapter 7: Service Decision</h2>

<p>
  In the FLEX Supply Chain Management Simulation, service management is outsourced to reputable call-center service providers 
  in each region. This approach allows firms to leverage external expertise and infrastructure while focusing on core supply 
  chain activities. Service outsourcing is region-specific, and you can choose from four available service outsourcing levels, 
  in addition to level "0" ("None," which implies no service is provided). The per-call costs and associated guaranteed service 
  quality performance levels ("SQ Guarantee") for each region are detailed below:
</p>

<h3>Service Outsourcing Levels and Costs</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Service Outsourcing Level</th>
      <th>Region 1</th>
      <th>Region 2</th>
      <th>Region 3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>"Minimum" [1]</td>
      <td>
        Cost/Call: $6<br>
        SQ Guarantee: 10%
      </td>
      <td>
        Cost/Call: $7<br>
        SQ Guarantee: 10%
      </td>

        Cost/Call: $8<br>
        SQ Guarantee: 10%
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"Standard" [2]</td>

        SQ Guarantee: 20%
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        Cost/Call: $16<br>
        SQ Guarantee: 30%
      </td>
      <td>

        SQ Guarantee: 30%
      </td>

        SQ Guarantee: 30%
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"Premium" [4]</td>
      <td>
        Cost/Call: $24<br>
        SQ Guarantee: 40%
      </td>
      <td>
        Cost/Call: $27<br>
        SQ Guarantee: 40%
      </td>
      <td>
        Cost/Call: $32<br>
        SQ Guarantee: 40%
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Service Quality Guarantees</h3>

<p>
  These "SQ Guarantees" are long-run averages. Service-center outsourcers guarantee that perceived service quality won't vary 
  by more than 3% from these averages in any quarter. Costs for call-center service outsourcing are reported as 
  "Service Outsourcing" on your financial and operating reports.
