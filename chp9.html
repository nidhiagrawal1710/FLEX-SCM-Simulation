<h2>Chapter 9: Forecasting Decisions</h2>

<p>
  Good forecasts are important. In FLEX, quarterly sales volume forecasts are required for retail and direct channel sales 
  in each region for each of your products. While explicit recorded replacement parts forecasts are not required, you will 
  need to forecast replacement parts demand to manage your inventories of sub-assemblies.
</p>

<h3>Impact of Forecasting Accuracy</h3>

<p>
  Accurate forecasting is critical for managing administrative overhead costs. For every 1% inaccuracy in your sales volume 
  forecasts, administrative overhead costs increase by 1%. For example, a forecast error of 10% (whether positive or negative) 
  for a product in a region increases the administrative overhead costs for that product in that region by 10%.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Maximum Penalty:</strong> The maximum administrative overhead penalty associated with sales forecasting 
      inaccuracy for each product in each region is a doubling of administrative overhead.</li>
  <li><strong>Forecast Error Costs:</strong> Forecast error costs are recorded as “Forecast Inaccuracy” costs on your firm’s 
      profit-and-loss statements. The reported base administrative overhead costs are always $80,000/quarter and 
      $120,000/quarter per product in channels 1 and 2, respectively, in all market regions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Sales volume forecasting decisions are independent of your procurement and production decisions. Sales volume forecasting 
  decisions are your best estimates of customer demand. However, your actual procurement and production decisions will be 
  based on additional factors, such as fixed order costs and target inventory levels.
</p>

<h3>Forecasting Accuracy Calculation</h3>

<p>
  Forecasting accuracy is one of the components of the multi-factor FLEX performance evaluation scorecard described in 
  Chapter 15. Forecasting accuracy influences operating performance both directly (via adjustments in base administrative 
  overhead for forecasting inaccuracies) and indirectly (via inventory pipeline inefficiencies [too much or too little inventory]).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Forecasting Accuracy Formula:</strong><br>
    <code>
     Forecasting Accuracy=100×(1−∣Forecast−Actual∣Actual)\text{Forecasting Accuracy} = 100 \times \left(1 - \frac{|\text{Forecast} - \text{Actual}|}{\text{Actual}}\right)Forecasting Accuracy=100×(1−Actual∣Forecast−Actual∣)
    </code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Example:</strong> A forecast value of 11,000 and an actual value of 8,000 results in a forecasting accuracy of:<br>
    <code>
     100×(1−∣11,000−8,000∣8,000)=100×(1−3,0008,000)=100×(1−0.375)=62.5%100 \times \left(1 - \frac{|11,000 - 8,000|}{8,000}\right) = 100 \times \left(1 - \frac{3,000}{8,000}\right) = 100 \times (1 - 0.375) = 62.5\%100×(1−8,000∣11,000−8,000∣)=100×(1−8,0003,000)=100×(1−0.375)=62.5%
    </code>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The minimum possible value of forecasting accuracy is 0.0%. For example, with an actual sales volume of 8,000, 
  a forecast above 16,000 results in a forecasting accuracy score of 0.0%.
